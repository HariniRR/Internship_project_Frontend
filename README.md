# IQAC Monthly Report using MERN Stack

The **"IQAC Monthly Report using MERN Stack"** is my internship project, is a web application designed to streamline activity management within an educational institution. It centralizes documentation for departmental activities, faculty initiatives, student participation, and institutional events. The platform allows users to efficiently manage and track various activities, including:
- Awards and achievements
- Club events
- Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities
- Lectures and course completions
- Certifications
- Internships
- Industrial visits
- Value-added courses

Each section is equipped with a dedicated form to ensure accurate record-keeping and efficient management of all activities, contributing to improved reporting and data management for IQAC.

This repository contains the frontend code for the IQAC Monthly Report project. The backend code for this project is hosted in a separate repository. You can find it here:

This data management system allows users to log in, submit, update, and retrieve data via forms. The processed data is stored in a database and displayed for analysis and reporting.
